# Scatterplot of mtcars dataset

```{r, echo = F, message = FALSE}

library(plotly)

date <- Sys.Date()

```

The date of the assignment is `r date`.  
The size of the point is determined by `wt`.  
`0` and `1` represent whether the car has an automatic or manual transmission, respectively.

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}

plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~qsec, y = ~mpg, color = ~factor(am),
        size = ~wt, type = 'scatter') %>%
        layout(title = 'mpg vs qsec, weight, and transmission',
               legend = list(title=list(text='<b> Transmission </b>')))
```
